                <h2>&nbsp;Blood Pressure</h2>
                <h3>What is Blood Pressure?</h3>
                <p>Blood Pressure (BP) is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of the body's
                    arteries. It's measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and recorded with two numbers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Systolic Pressure:</strong> The pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diastolic Pressure:</strong> The pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Normal Blood Pressure Range</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Normal BP:</strong> Systolic &lt; 120 mmHg and Diastolic &lt; 80 mmHg.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elevated BP:</strong> Systolic 120-129 mmHg and Diastolic &lt; 80 mmHg.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypertension Stage 1:</strong> Systolic 130-139 mmHg or Diastolic 80-89 mmHg.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypertension Stage 2:</strong> Systolic ≥ 140 mmHg or Diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Causes of High Blood Pressure</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary (Essential) Hypertension:</strong> No identifiable cause, develops over many
                        years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Hypertension:</strong> Caused by an underlying condition, such as kidney
                        disease, adrenal gland tumors, thyroid problems, or certain medications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms of High Blood Pressure</h3>
                <p>Often called the "silent killer" because it may not cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Headaches</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Nosebleeds</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heart Attack or Stroke:</strong> High BP can cause hardening and thickening of the
                        arteries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aneurysm:</strong> Increased BP can cause blood vessels to weaken and bulge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heart Failure:</strong> The heart has to work harder to pump blood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kidney Damage:</strong> Can lead to kidney failure.</li>
                </ul>
                </ul>

                <h1>Welcome to medHearts</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to our Blood Pressure Prediction tool, designed to help you understand and manage your blood
                    pressure effectively. Regular monitoring is key to preventing and controlling high blood pressure, a
                    condition that can lead to serious health issues if left unmanaged.
                </p>
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Our tool provides a comprehensive assessment based on the information you provide. Simply enter your
                    personal details and recent blood pressure readings, if available. You’ll receive an insightful
                    analysis and practical advice to help you manage your health better.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter your personal information including age, gender, and weight.</li>
                    <li>Input your latest blood pressure readings if you have them.</li>
                    <li>Answer questions about your lifestyle such as diet, exercise habits, and smoking status.</li>
                    <li>Click "Predict" to receive your results and recommendations.</li>

                <h3>How the Model Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Our prediction model uses the information you provide to estimate your blood pressure status and
                    stage. It incorporates various factors, including your age, weight, and lifestyle choices, to
                    generate an accurate prediction. Here’s how it works:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We collect data on personal factors like age, weight, and
                        recent blood pressure readings, along with lifestyle information such as diet and physical
                        activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> The model evaluates the data against known benchmarks and criteria
                        to estimate your blood pressure stage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> It analyzes the input data to provide a detailed report on your blood
                        pressure status, highlighting any areas of concern.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Based on the results, the tool offers prediction of your current
                        Hypertension stage.</li>
                </ul>
